# Update_Business_Implementation_Bank_Marketing_Term_Deposit_Novia_Wulandari

Hi I'm Novia Wulandari a data enthusiast who has just started my data learning journey by joining the bootcamp data science batch 17. This project is about making various kinds of machine learning that is suitable for use by dataset that can predict a customer will take a deposit or not. I got this Dataset Bank Marketing Analysis from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-dataset)

I did an update by calculating (Cumulative Gains Curve) the business case with the prevailing interest rate in one of the conventional banks in Indonesia, namely calculating the benefits you get if you use a machine learning model and if you don't use a machine learning model.

Overall Steps:

* Import all Libraries & Load the Dataset
* Split Data (Train and test)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) categorical data and numrical data
* Removing redundant variable based on business value
* Data Preparation: Data Train
  * Drop duplicated data
  * Outliers analysis
  * Removing outliers
  * Missing value handling
* Data Preparation: Data Test
  * Drop duplicated data
  * Outliers analysis
  * Removing outliers
  * Missing value handling
* Split data into Xtrain, ytrain, Xtest, ytest
* Chi-Square test
* Encoding preparation
* Encode separately for data train and data test
* Split Xtrain and Xtest into different categories
* Standar Scaller
* Modelling Classification ML algorithms:
  * Logistic Regression
  * K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
  * Naive Bayes
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * Tree Based
    * Decision Tree
    * Random Forest
    * XGBoost
* Evaluation Model
  * Learning curve Regression
  * Learning curve K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
  * Learning curve Naive Bayes
  * Learning curve Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * Learning curve Decision Tree
  * Learning curve Random Forest
  * Learning curve XGBoost
* Tuning Model
  * Tuning Model Logistic Regression Model with GridSearch and RandomSearch
  * Tuning Model SVM Model with GridSearch and RandomSearch
  * Tuning Model Naive Bayes Model with GridSearch and RandomSearch
* Feature Importance with Dalex
* Business Case (Cumulative Gains Curve)

Thank You in Advance!
